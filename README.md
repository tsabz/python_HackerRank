## ASCII - using numbers to represent text
- it's a way for computers to store characters easily in its memory by convertiving them to numbers
### uppercase A is always asigned the number 65
### ! is always number 33
###  ASCII Charactars = 128 
### Unicode Charactars = 1,114,112
### Lowercase a (97) - uppercase A (65) = 32
### Lowercase b (98) - uppcaser B (66) = 32
    
## turning decimal numbers into bianary code 
    ```
        10110110

        182 - what numbers add to 182?
         128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 - 128 , 32 , 16, 4, 2
          1   0  1  1 0 1 1 0 - fills those numbers in with 1 and the rest 0
    ```

 ### Every single key on your keyboard has a number associated with it 

 ### ASCII has 7 bits
 - meaning it has numbers 64, 32, 16, 8 , 4, 2, 1 to preform as many cobincations to create 128 numbers
    - for example: 
    #### Binary Combination for A = 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
    ```
    Binary combination for letter A = 65, 64 + 1

    64 32 16 8 4 2 1 
    1  0  0  0 0 0 1

    Binary Combination for A = 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
    ```

### Unicode can represent more bits than ASCII 8, 16 or 32 BITS
        - 32 BITS = 2,147,483,647
    - meaning it can use a wider range of combainatinos to represent different symbols and alphabets/ emojis
